# FashionHub Project

This is a Spring Boot project for FashionHub, an online fashion store platform.
This project is originally created by my friend. I contributed the following updates and improvements:

## What I have done

- **Home Page Enhancements**
  - Added **drop-down menus** for categories.
  - Added a **Reels section** for trending products.
- **CSS and UI Updates**
  - Improved styling for a more interactive and professional look.
- **Database Configurations**
  - Removed sensitive information (database password) from `application.properties`.
- **Commit and Version Control**
  - Ensured the project changes are committed properly and pushed to my GitHub repository.
- Implemented **controllers** for main pages:
  - `MainController` for home, login, categories, about, contact pages.

## Notes
- This README only covers my personal contributions to the project.
- Database password has been removed from the repo history.
- Project uses **Spring Boot 3**, **Thymeleaf**, and **MySQL**.
